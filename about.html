        <p class="des">
            I'm Sharath, a B.Tech student at Anurag University majoring in 
            Computer Science Engineering, with a deep focus on UI/UX Design.
            Since childhood, I’ve been the kind of person who loves fixing and
            creating things — whether it was customizing my gadgets, sketching 
            random logos, or redesigning everyday tools to make them more useful. 
            That love for problem-solving slowly led me to the world of digital 
            design and technology.
        </p>

        <p class="des">
            In college, I discovered UX design, and it instantly felt like the 
            perfect space where creativity, empathy, and tech meet. Now, through 
            my designs, I aim to build thoughtful, accessible, and meaningful 
            experiences that not only look good but genuinely help people in their 
            everyday lives.Whether it’s crafting intuitive apps, working on personal
            side projects, or diving into new financial tools, I believe in creating 
            things that solve real problems and spark real joy.
